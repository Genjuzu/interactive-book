# interactive-book

Hey there,

I would like to add my idea for an interactive website. 

I am writing fiction and already archieved character consistency using Stable Diffusion!

So i am now able to generate a full blown graphic novel - but on top of that: I would like to animate them with ai.

Since i am a music producer too, i am working on a soundtrack and also want to add some soundeffects, that are triggered by the reading process.

All of that needs to be implemented on a beautiful, artistical website.

I am looking for any help possible =)

Greetings, 

CleveR.
